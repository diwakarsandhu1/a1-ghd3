Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3 (PacMan)
===

Live Demo
---
There is a live demo link through GitHub Pages to view the visualization. [View Visualization Here!] (https://diwakarsandhu1.github.io/a1-ghd3/)

Description
---
For this visualization I wanted to focus on creating something that had some type of movement and was not a static SVG, and the first thing that came to mind was PacMan. The visual elements are created through d3 elements using different shapes and colors. The mouth of PacMan is animated using a d3 arc that animates to simulate eating. Both for pellet and mouth movement, the d3 timer and interval were used to understand the differneces between their mechanics, however, mainly JavaScript was used for the logic and movement itself.

To build this visualization I utilized the d3 Documentation from https://d3js.org as well as Copilot (AI) to refresh myself on HTML basics and formatting.
